  <h1>About</h1>      
  <p>Tedfords Kitchen...Supplying quality food and drinks since 2008!</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Chef/Proprietor Niall Tedford moved to Donegal in 2008 where he opened his first restaurant “TEDFORDs” at 5 Dame Street. The restaurant and Niall quickly gained a great reputation for  serving excellent, fresh local Meat and Seafood.  The now signature dish of Curry Roast Monkfish with shellfish wonton, coconut rice & pak choy has been so popular it has to stayed on the menu for 13 years!</h3> 
<br>
<br>

  <h3>In 2015 having watched the area and Slieve League Hotel flourish, Niall together with his partner Stephen launched a new venture “TEDFORDs KITCHEN” initially the two restaurants operated in tandem. However today all operation has moved to this hotel collaborated site where the experienced team create some amazing dishes using only the best local, quality ingredients.  Meat features heavily on the menu alongside fish/shellfish as you would expect and vegetarians are catered for too.</h3>      
<br>
<br>  
  
  <h3>Front of house the airy interior dining space is casual by day and cosy contemporary by night. And during those summer afternoons the outdoor terrace overlooking the river is available for long lazy lunches or an afternoon catch up with family or friends. Alfresco dining is available when the Belfast weather permits. Fully licensed there is an extensive wine list, a creative cocktail list and a supply of draft beer – our bar is always fully stocked. TEDFORDs KITCHEN is perfect day or night.</h3>

  <h3>The Slieve League is an Amazing place, at TEDFORDs KITCHEN we are waiting to welcome you.</h3>
